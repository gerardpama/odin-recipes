    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 batch of pizza dough</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons of pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup of shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of shredded parmesan</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of chopped chives</li>
        <li>1/4 tablespoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>All purpose flour</li>
        <li>Semolina flour</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 230ÂºC for 30 minutes, if available insert pizza stone in the oven during preheating</li>
        <li>Leave pizza dought for 20-30 minutes at room temperature</li>
        <li>Dust semolina flur on pizza stone</li>
        <li>In a bowl mix mozzarella, parmesan, chives and oregano together</li>
        <li>Dust a clean work surface with all-purpose flour, and then form your pizza dough into a round, large enough to fit your pizza peel or pan. To stretch the dough, avoid rolling it out, as this can flatten the bubbles that have formed. Instead, use your fingers to make dimples in the dough, starting from the center and working outwards. Carefully stretch and push the dough to fit your pizza pan or peel. Use a light touch to maintain as many air pockets in the dough as possible.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough round to your pizza peel or pan, and reform it if it shrinks back a bit</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce over the pizza, leaving a thin edge untouched for the crust. Scatter the cheese mixture over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake until the crust is set and golden brown and the cheese has melted with golden spots all over, 6 to 15 minutes, depending on oven temperature. Remove from the oven, cut, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
